<p>I see it<br />
I know it<br />
I know exactly how its gonna be<br />
Mmmm</p>

<p>I feel it<br />
I know it<br />
And I don't want to wake up from this dream</p>

<p>Although I hope<br />
How I've hoped<br />
But yet I know<br />
That you go home</p>

<p>I sit still<br />
And I don't breath<br />
I know exactly what you gonna say<br />
Mmmm</p>

<p>But I can't understand<br />
I feel so dumb and blind</p>

<p>Although I hope<br />
How I've hoped<br />
No, No<br />
But yet I know. You go</p>

<p>I still love the way you used to be<br />
Don't you remember<br />
Oh, no, what you mean to me</p>

<p>Hold on to thoughts we ask them be<br />
Don't want to try, no<br />
Don't have you ever tried at all?<br />
Don't go</p>

<p>I will rise and won't will fall</p>

<p>Don't go<br />
Now breath in, now breath out<br />
I know exactly how it's gonna be<br />
Mmmm</p>

<p>Kill me<br />
and drain me<br />
You don't want to see<br />
Ooh, ooh, ooh</p>

<p>And I know<br />
And I know<br />
No, no, that you will go<br />
You go home</p>

<p>I still love the way that used to be<br />
Don't you remember?<br />
Oh, no</p>

<p>Now what you mean to me<br />
Hold on to thoughts we ask them be</p>

<p>Ooh, ooh, ooh</p>

<p>Have you ever tried at all?<br />
Don't go</p>

<p>I will rise and won't will fall</p>

<p>Don't go<br />
Don't go<br />
Don't<br />
Don't go</p>

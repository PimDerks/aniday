<p>If you got something to say<br />
Tell me now, straight in my face<br />
You got me cornered in this dreadfull, weary state of mind<br />
Got me blinded in a place that no one else can find<br />
It's so inhumane</p>

<p>Don't fool with me !<br />
If you've got something to say,<br />
tell it to my face,<br />
don't seel me</p>

<p>Don't fool with me !<br />
Now you got me paralysed,<br />
cut me down to size,<br />
deceived me<br />
Don't fool with me.</p>

<p>All these dreams, faded away<br />
Just my heart, whacked out and fey<br />
You keep me guessing in this prison-cell of hope and lies,<br />
keep me waiting while you know I only waste my life<br />
It's so inhumane</p>

<p>Don't fool with me !<br />
If you've got something to say, <br />
tell it to my face, <br />
don't seel me</p>

<p>Don't fool with me !<br />
Now you got me paralysed, <br />
cut me down to size, <br />
deceived me<br />
Now at least you gotta set me free</p>

<p>Where do I go from here... Where do I go, where did I go....</p>

<p>Don't fool with me !<br />
Now you got me paralysed, <br />
cut me down to size, <br />
deceived me<br/>
Now at least you gotta set me free<br />
I've had enough of all your lies<br />
Look into my eyes, they're bleeding</p>

<p>Don't fool with me!<br />
You're acting like a demon in disguise, <br />
don't be so cold as ice, I need you<br />
Babe I beg you to make me see<br />
Love me or set me free</p>

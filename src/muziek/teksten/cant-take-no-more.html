<p>How could you say it's God's will<br />
We can't be together<br />
How could you blame it on Him<br />
When it's you who broke my heart</p>

<p>Night after night I broke down<br />
How I waited for you<br />
Nine million tears I have cried<br />
Guess it all was in vain</p>

<p>Only time will tell, that's all you could say<br />
While you let it all fade away</p>

<p>I can't take no more - Get me out of here<br />
I can't take no more - Get me out of here<br />
From this lonely life without you<br />
I can't take no more - Get me out of here<br />
I can't take no more - Get me out of here<br />
From this world I built around you</p>

<p>Tortured and torn up inside<br />
Left with great confusion<br />
Wasted, ignored and denied<br />
This is too much to take</p>


<p>There's a war inside that's raging so bad</br >
Destroyed everything that I had</p>

<p>No more! No more!</p>

<p>In this lonely hell,<br />
day after day<br />
I'm wasting, I'm wasting away</p>

<p>Not much of a man<br />
If you really knew me<br />
Than you'd understand<br />
But you stole my love<br />
And went away</p>

<p>When you were near to me<br />
Things seemed so very light<br />
But you stole my love<br />
And went away</p>

<p>Not much of a man<br />
You don't see me<br />
Can't you understand<br />
What kind of man would steal this love<br />
And go away</p>

<p>Now all what I give to you<br />
Is hardly ever<br />
What I receive<br />
And all the sweet words<br />
That I long to believe<br />
Never told me to leave<br />
And now what to do</p>

<p>It used to be so much easier<br />
To carry my burdens<br />
With you here</p>

<p>Not much of a man<br />
You don't see me<br />
Can't you understand<br />
What kind of man would steal this love<br />
And go away</p>

<p>Not much of a man<br />
You don't see me<br />
And I cannot understand<br />
How this man could take my love<br />
And go away<br />
Away</p>

<p>You just told me that it's wrong<br/>
That what we have just can't go on<br/>
And I here the voice inside me say<br/>
You're maybe true it's right this way, but still.....<br/>
I can't hide what I feel</p>

<p>Our love did save me, pulled me up<br/>
What will become of me now that it stops<br/>
And I'm scared to death how hard I'll fall<br/>
I wonder do you care at all how I feel</p>

<p>There's a storm coming down tonight<br/>
And I hear myself calling, reach out to you so in vain</p>

<p>Can you hear me, can you hear me<br/>
When I keep telling you, begging you<br/>
Lay my heart on the line<br/>
Can you hear me, can you hear me through this song<br/>
When loving you is wrong</p>

<p>Back to where I used to be - <br/>
Left with nothing, my destiny<br/>
And I feel just like a freaking fool <br/>
to think that I belonged to you<br/>
That's right...<p>

<p>Do you know how it hurts inside<br/>
That you chose to abandon our love and keep living your lie</p>

<p>There's a storm coming down tonight<br/>
And I hear myself calling, reach out to you so in vain</p>

<p>Can you hear me, can you hear me<br/>
When I keep telling you, begging you<br/>
Lay my heart on the line<br/>
Can you hear me , can you hear me,<br/>
When I keep telling you, begging you,<br/>
Confessing you I'm in love with you<br/>
Can you hear me, can you hear me through this song<br/>
When loving you is wrong</p>

<p>And it doesn’t really matter what you say now,<br/>
Anything at all.<br/>
Seems you’re trying here to seize me darling<br/>
Love will drown me, let me fall<br/>
And it doesn’t really matter how I try now<br/>
I have no hope at all<br/>
Cause we’ve been trough all this long before<br/>
Where can I go</p>

<p>Leave me with your lies<br/>
Leave me with your lies<br/>
And I’d do it all over again now,<br/>
And I’d do it all over again<br/>
Leave me with your lies<br/>
Leave me with your lies<br/>
And I’d do it all over again<br/>
Although it feels like something in me dies</p>

<p>Maybe you were never there for me, now<br/>
not really at all<br/>
But I’d like to see what you’re like inside<br/>
Even though I know you’ll let me fall<br/>
And I know I should know better<br/>
But I like to think I know it all<br/>
Cause we’ve been trough all of this before<br/>
Where can I go</p>

<p>Leave me with your lies<br/>
Leave me with your lies<br/>
And I’d do it all over again now,<br/>
And I’d do it all over again<br/>
Leave me with your lies<br/>
Leave me with your lies<br/>
And I’d do it all over again<br/>
Although it Feels like something in me dies</p>

<p>Gotta find a way somehow...<br/>
Gotta break away from this missing-you life<br/>
Gotta make a change, but it seems I will never know how<br/>
No</p>

<p>Praying 'till my knees get sore<br/>
Do you want me to beg for a lifetime or more<br/>
Staring through my tears at the writings so vague on the wall</p>

<p>I die from this never-ending pain<br/>
I'm on the verge of going insane</p>

<p>There's a hole in my heart<br/>
Because of you I'm next to nothing<br/>
There's no light in the dark<br/>
No escape from it all<br/>
There's a hole in my heart<br/>
And I don't have a clue<br/>
How to face this world without you</p>

<p>Gotta find a way somehow...<br/>
No matter what it takes, I need you back in my life<br/>
Cause every single day I'm drifting much further away</p>

<p>And burn dry, becoming more estranged<br/>
I'm on the verge of going insane</p>

<p>There's a hole in my heart<br/>
Because of you I'm next to nothing<br/>
There's no light in the dark<br/>
No escape from it all<br/>
There's a hole in my heart<br/>
And I don't have a clue<br/>
How to face this world without you</p>

<p>There's a hole in my heart<br/>
Because of you I'm next to nothing<br/>
There's no light in the dark<br/>
No escape from it all<br/>
There's a hole in my heart<br/>
And I don't have a clue<br/>
How to face this life without you</p>

<p>No !
I'm next to nothing<br/>
There's no light in the dark<br/>
No escape from the storm<br/>
There's a hole in my heart<br/>
And I don't have a clue<br/>
How to find a cure for this hole in my heart<br/>
No matter what I do<br/>
It could only be filled by you<br/>
Yeah ! Oh !</p>

<p>Gotta find a way some how</p>

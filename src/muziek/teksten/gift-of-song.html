<p>They tell me<br />
This is harder to you<br />
Than it‘ll ever be to me<br />
But how possibly??<br />
I cannot see<br />
Can I ever return to<br />
The way it used to be</p>

<p>I am able to go anywhere<br />
But yet I am not free<br />
The sand and everything<br />
Just gave up on me</p>

<p>What else can you give<br />
When we cannot be…<br />
What more than your words<br />
And the lovely gift of song<br />
What else can I do to make you set me free?<br />
When we both know we belong<br />
To each other</p>

<p>I need you now</p>

<p>Hey maybe it’s just all in my head<br />
When the problem is myself<br />
I start thinking<br />
Who are you?</p>

<p>I am able to go anywhere<br />
But yet I am not free<br />
The sand and everything<br />
Just gave up on me</p>

<p>What else can you give<br />
When we cannot be…<br />
What more than your words<br />
And the lovely gift of song<br />
What do I got to do to make you set me free<br />
When we both know we belong<br />
To each other</p>

<p>How I want you now</p>

<p>Is it really true what they say?<br />
Someone took your heart away...<br />
Baby can you hear me?<br />
Don’t tell me all my love is in vain<br />
Everything we had gone to waste<br />
Baby can you hear me?</p>

<p>You left me here without an answer<br />
And changed my world into a hell</p>

<p>Because of you, I lost the way<br />
I'm wrapped in dismay<br />
How am I gonna make it through tomorrow<br />
Such a fool, for such a fake<br />
It’s a truth I can't take<br />
Now that all of my fears became real</p>

<p>Such a wicked cruel game you played<br />
Pretended we would marry one day<br />
While you weren't near me<br />
Still i can’t believe this is real<br />
That anything should come in between<br />
Oh, Baby can you hear me</p>

<p>You were the one my dream my angel<br />
Why did you change my world into a hell?</p>

<p>Because of you, I lost the way<br />
I'm wrapped in dismay<br />
How am I gonna make it through tomorrow<br />
Such a fool, for such a fake<br />
It’s a truth I can't take<br />
Now that all of my fears became real</p>

<p>Don’t justify your wicked mind<br />
Your fairytales and vicious lies<br />
I'm begging you<br />
Break the spell</p>

<p>Because of you… I lost the way<br />
But how am I gonna make it through tomorrow....</p>

<p>Because of you, I lost the way<br />
I'm wrapped in dismay<br />
How am I gonna make it through tomorrow<br />
Such a fool, for such a fake<br />
It’s a truth I can't take<br />
Now that all of my fears became real<br />
I lost the way<br />
I'm wrapped in dismay<br />
How am I gonna make it through tomorrow<br />
I’m such a fool, for such a fake<br />
It’s a truth I can't take</p>

<p>Now the devil in you is revealed<br />
And all of my fears<br />
Became real</p>

<p>Is it really true what they say?</p>
